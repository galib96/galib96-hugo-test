      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Student of Chemical Engineering at the University of Tennessee. On the way to Ph.D., finished my MS in Chemical Engineering from the University of Tennessee in 2024. Before that, after finishing B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2019, I cofounded an EdTech company named Bohubrihi in 2019 with the goal of providing technical online courses in Bangla for tertiary students and professionals helping them to advance in their career. I took the exit from Bohubrihi in late 2021 during its acquisition by Shikho technologies Bangladesh Ltd.
